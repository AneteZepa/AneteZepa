## ✨ About Me
I’m an **AI & Computer Science graduate** with 5+ years of experience creating technical education for developers and beginners alike.  
I’ve worked with companies (startups mostly) like **Sololearn**, **Code First Girls**, **Multiverse**, and **Flip Computing** ([check out Flock XR!](https://flockxr.com/)), where I designed and delivered courses on topics ranging from **Web Dev**, **Java**, and **data science** to **Gen AI**.  

Currently freelancing and open to **global opportunities** in:  
- Developer Advocacy  
- Tech Education & Technical Writing  
- AI & Data Science  
- Project/Program Management

## 📚 What I'm Up To
- 🎮 Learning **Game Design with Godot**  
- 📈 Sharpening my **Project Management** skills using courses
- 💪 Regular at the gym (weights > cardio)  
- 🫖 Enjoy both tea & coffee 
- 🌞 Love summer, not so much the early autumn chill and darkness
- 📖 Weekends = reading books, playing (video) games, and writing for my new [blog](https://anetezepa.github.io/blog/)

  • Built & ran hackathons back in uni, created women coding communities at CFG, and still love community building  <br/>
  • Happy to have a chat about most topics - feel free to reach out!<br/>
