## About me
I’m an **AI & Computer Science graduate** with 5+ years of experience creating technical education for developers and beginners alike.  
I’ve worked with companies (startups mostly) like **Sololearn**, **Code First Girls**, **Multiverse**, and **Flip Computing** ([check out Flock XR!](https://flockxr.com/)), where I designed and delivered courses on topics ranging from **Web Dev**, **Java**, and **data science** to **Machine Lerning** and **Generative AI**.  

Currently freelancing and open to **global opportunities** in:    
- AI, ML & Data Science  
- Project/Program Management
- Developer Advocacy  
- Tech Education & Technical Writing

## A bit more about me
- Learning more about embedded ML ([check out my bee project](https://github.com/AneteZepa/HappyBees))
- Regular at the gym (weights > cardio)
- I enjoy both tea & coffee, especially with a sweet treat
- I love summer and snow, not so much the autumn chill and darkness
- Love to do DIY from painting to renovating kitchens, making things with my hands, not just digitally
- Still writing articles or talking about things that matter

## GitHub stats

Admittedly, I have been quiet here on GitHub for the last year or so - but I am bringing it back to life!

  • Based in Riga, Latvia, open to global roles  <br/>
  • Supporter of AI (great for putting a lot on the paper quickly, but definitely needs editing) — but mindful of flaws, overuse & IP concerns  <br/>
  • Built & ran hackathons back in uni, created women coding communities at CFG, and still love community building  <br/>
  • Happy to have a chat about most topics - feel free to reach out either on LinkedIn or email!<br/>
